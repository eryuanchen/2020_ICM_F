This is the paper and Matlab code for the project "EDP Immigration Policies Report Based on Logistic Model and SEIR Model", a 2022 ICM contest Problem F Meritorious Winner project by me and other 2 pals.

There is a slightly modification in the coding, leading to color of graphs changed compared to the original one.

For full data or other information, please contact me.
